# BedTransfer
This is a project to allow hospital staff to more efficiently manage their available beds, which would replace a dated phone system.

Unfortunately, this project was unsuccessful, but now the prototype lives here. You can go have a look at the deployed version **[HERE]**(https://bedtransfer-e9489.web.app/).

After consulting with medical specialists, we developed a plan for a platform, which would consist of three components
- Clinician management page - Doctors needing beds for patients can make new requests to ward managers.
- Ward Manager page - Ward managers could approve, deny or forward requests for beds, as well as send messages to doctors to discuss their needs
- Porters Page - Once a request was accepted, a porter would be notified, to transport the patient to their new bed. Again, the porter would be able to communicate with the ward manager to move the patient.

It was my responsibility to realise these ideas, and the result of that is what can be seen at the above link.
Note that the site is not very mobile friendly, as this was just a proof of concept.
